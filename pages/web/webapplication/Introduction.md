# Introduction to Web Application

> A web application is a computer program that utilizes web browsers and web technologies to perform tasks over the Internet.

## Why Web Applications?

Several people are using the Internet as a cost effective medium to communicate. Through internet, one can easily exchange information in a secure and more managed way. For example, various businesses are now established online.

## How Web Application Works?

Web appliation is coded in a browser supported language like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as these languages require browser to render and run the application.

There are two types of web applications:
- Dynamic Web Application: requiring server-side processing
- Static Web Application: requiring no processing

The web application requires a web server to manage requests from the client, an application server to perform the tasks requested, and, sometimes, a database to store the information. Application server technology ranges from ASP.NET, to JS.

Web Application work flow:
- user triggers the request to the web serve, either through a web browser or the application
- web server forwards the request to the appropriate web server
- web application server performs the requested task – such as querying the database or processing the data – then generates the results of the requested data
- web application server sends results to the web server with the requested information or processed data
- web server responds back to the client with the requested information that then appears on the user’s display
