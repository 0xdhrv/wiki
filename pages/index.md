# Introduction

### Welcome to My Digital Garden

This is my digital garden where I write mostly about code, design, minimalism, psychology, philosophy, art, and music. It is an attempt to share knowledge with the world in a form of a collaborative online project that is hosted on Github.

This project is like a digital garden, which was planted on the internet at **06, Dec, 2020**.
