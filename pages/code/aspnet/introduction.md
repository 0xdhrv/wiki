# Introduction to ASP.NET

> ASP.NET is an open source web framework, created by Microsoft, for building modern web apps and services with .NET.

ASP.NET is cross platform and runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker.

## Extension to .NET

ASP.NET extends the .NET platform with tools and libraries specifically for building web apps.

- Base framework for processing web requests in C# or F#.
- Web-page templating syntax, known as Razor, for building dynamic web pages using C#.
- Libraries for common web patterns, such as Model View Controller (MVC).
- Authentication system that includes libraries, a database, and template pages for handling logins, including multi-factor authentication and external authentication with Google, Twitter, and more.
- Editor extensions to provide syntax highlighting, code completion, and other functionality specifically for developing web pages.

## Used for Back-end Code

When using ASP.NET one's back-end code, such as business logic and data access, is written using C#, F#, or Visual Basic. Because ASP.NET extends .NET, you can use the large ecosystem of packages and libraries available to all .NET developers.

## Dynamic web pages using C#, HTML, CSS, and JS

Razor provides a syntax for creating dynamic web pages using HTML and C#. Your C# code is evaluated on the server and the resulting HTML content is sent to the user.

Code that executes client-side is written in JavaScript. ASP.NET integrates with JavaScript frameworks and includes pre-configured templates for single page app (SPA) frameworks like React and Angular.

## Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker

ASP.NET apps can be developed and run on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker.

The Visual Studio family of products has tools for building .NET apps on any operating system. There are also command-line tools and extensions for many popular editors.

## Pages, APIs, real-time, and microservices

ASP.NET allows you to build many types of web applications, including web pages, REST APIs, microservices, and hubs that push real-time content to connected clients.
